<h1> My name is Sarah Kim, I am a Graphic design student attending MNSU. </h1>
    
<p>

I was born and raised in Minnesota and I am a senior graphic design student pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in graphic design. Photography is my second concentration and I enjoy both digital and film photography. Prior to studying at MNSU I had studied at normandale community college and graduated with an Associate of arts degree.

    <strong> Plans after graduation... </strong>

<p> 
    
Next fall I plan to apply for a remote internship that will help build my resume and experience. After graduation I plan to work for a graphic design company in Minnesota and hopefully In the future I would like to start my own business where I can work with clients to build more experience and also have my own flexible schedule. I think as a designer I would be most fulfilled and content if I worked in an environment where I can bring my own style and personality into my design.

    <h4> Things i enjoy outside of design </h4>

A few interests/hobbies of mine include traveling. I traveled to Monterrey Mexico to english for a week through a non profit organization and I also visited my relatives that live in South Korea. I enjoy cooking healthy food and have been a fan of making recipes off of pinterest.

In this course, I want to improve my skills in coding and learn the techniques on how to design a website that looks visually appealing with CSS. My goal for this course is to develop my knowledge and skills in coding and website design so that I can use them in the future when I build websites. I am also interested in making theme templates for a website.
